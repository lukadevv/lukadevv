Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luka
I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with a journey that began with creating Flash games. My early days were filled with the excitement of bringing interactive experiences to life, which naturally led me to dive deeper into programming.

Over time, I transitioned into Java development, where I honed my skills in building robust applications. This experience laid the foundation for my current focus on web development, where I work as a full-stack developer.

Today, I specialize in crafting seamless and dynamic web applications, blending both frontend and backend technologies to deliver complete solutions. Whether it's designing user-friendly interfaces or architecting scalable server-side logic, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
