I'm a **passionate Full Stack Developer** with a journey that began with creating **Flash games**. My early days were filled with the excitement of bringing interactive experiences to life, which naturally led me to dive deeper into programming.

Over time, I transitioned into **Java development**, where I honed my skills in building robust applications. This experience laid the foundation for my current focus on **web development**, where I work as a full-stack developer.

Today, I specialize in crafting seamless and dynamic web applications, blending both **frontend** and **backend** technologies to deliver complete solutions. Whether it's designing user-friendly interfaces or architecting scalable server-side logic, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
